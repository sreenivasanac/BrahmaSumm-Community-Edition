# BrahmaSumm: Next Feature Implementation Priority

Based on the project vision and current implementation, here are the top 5 features to implement next:

## 1. Interactive Knowledge Graph Implementation
**Priority: High**
- Create dynamic knowledge graphs from processed documents
- Enable visualization of relationships between document concepts
- Implement graph-based navigation of document contents
- Add ability to query the knowledge graph directly

**Why:** This aligns with the vision's emphasis on "Build knowledge graphs out of your documents" and enables more intuitive document exploration.

## 2. Vector Database Integration with RAG
**Priority: High**
- Implement vector storage for processed documents
- Enable semantic search capabilities
- Add version control for documents
- Support for processing 150,000+ documents as mentioned in vision

**Why:** Essential for scaling to "Super RAG on over 150,000+ docs" and enabling deep vector search capabilities mentioned in the vision.

## 3. Advanced Table and Image Processing
**Priority: Medium-High**
- Implement robust table extraction from PDFs and spreadsheets
- Add support for image analysis and chart interpretation
- Enable data visualization generation from extracted tables
- Create structured data from unstructured tables

**Why:** Addresses the vision's "Advanced Table Extraction" feature and "Multimodal LLM Models" capability.

## 4. Enterprise Integration Layer
**Priority: Medium**
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Add integration with Microsoft Teams and email systems
- Enable collaborative document processing
- Add secure document handling and encryption

**Why:** Matches the vision's emphasis on "Securely, privately and collaboratively" and enterprise workflow integration.

## 5. Custom Report Generation
**Priority: Medium**
- Implement customizable report templates
- Add support for different summary lengths (small/medium/large)
- Enable automatic code generation from technical documents
- Add diff-based summaries for document versions

**Why:** Fulfills the vision's "Generate Reports, Code, Emails" capability and "Custom Document Summaries" feature.

## Implementation Notes
- Each feature should maintain the current project's focus on efficient token usage
- Continue using the clustering and chunking approach that provides 99% cost reduction
- Ensure all new features integrate with the existing visualization capabilities
- Maintain compatibility with multiple LLM providers
